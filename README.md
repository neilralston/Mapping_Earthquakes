## Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive map depicting earthquake activity.

Using JavaScript, Leaflet, and HTML, the map includes the following functionality:
* Three base map options
* Three map overlays: earthquakes, major earthquakes (magnitude > 4.5), and tectonic plate locations
* Color and radius of circle markers based on the earthquake magnitude
* A popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer

## Results

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data 
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
